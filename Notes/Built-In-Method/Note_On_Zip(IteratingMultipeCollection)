### Understanding `zip()` in Python

`zip()` is a built-in Python function that takes two or more iterables (like lists, tuples, etc.) and aggregates them
into pairs of elements. It effectively "zips" the iterables together, creating tuples where each element from the first
iterable is paired with the corresponding element from the other iterable(s).

#### Syntax:
```python
zip(iterable1, iterable2, ...)
```

- **iterable1, iterable2, ...**: These can be any iterable objects (like lists, tuples, strings, etc.) that you want to
combine.

#### How `zip()` works:
- It will iterate over multiple iterables in parallel and return a list of tuples.
- Each tuple contains elements from each iterable at the same index position.

### Example:

```python
foods = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
prices = [1.50, 0.75, 1.25]

zipped = zip(foods, prices)

for food, price in zipped:
    print(f"{food} costs ${price:.2f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Apple costs $1.50
Banana costs $0.75
Orange costs $1.25
```

### Key Points:
1. **Stops at the shortest iterable**: If the iterables passed to `zip()` are of different lengths, the `zip()` function
 will stop creating pairs as soon as the shortest iterable is exhausted.
   ```python
   list1 = [1, 2, 3]
   list2 = ['a', 'b']

   zipped = list(zip(list1, list2))
   print(zipped)
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]
   ```
   The third element of `list1` is ignored because `list2` has only two elements.

2. **Unzipping with `zip()`**: You can "unzip" a list of tuples back into individual lists using `zip(*zipped)`.

   ```python
   zipped = [('Apple', 1.5), ('Banana', 0.75), ('Orange', 1.25)]
   foods, prices = zip(*zipped)

   print(foods)  # ('Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange')
   print(prices)  # (1.5, 0.75, 1.25)
   ```

3. **Multiple Iterables**: You can zip more than two iterables if needed.
   ```python
   list1 = [1, 2]
   list2 = ['a', 'b']
   list3 = [True, False]

   zipped = zip(list1, list2, list3)
   print(list(zipped))
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   [(1, 'a', True), (2, 'b', False)]
   ```

4. **Use Case in Loops**: `zip()` is frequently used to loop over multiple lists or iterables at the same time, as seen
 in your example with foods and prices.

### Use in the Shopping Cart Example:

In the shopping cart example, you have two separate lists: `foods` and `prices`. Using `zip()` allows you to pair each
food with its corresponding price and display them together. This is a clean and efficient way to handle related data
stored in separate lists.

```python
foods = ["Apple", "Banana"]
prices = [1.50, 0.75]

# Use zip to pair food items with their prices
for food, price in zip(foods, prices):
    print(f"{food}  ---- ${price:.2f}")
```

### Conclusion:
`zip()` is a powerful and convenient tool in Python for working with multiple iterables in parallel, and it's perfect
for situations like displaying related data (e.g., food names and prices) together in a loop. It simplifies the code by
eliminating the need for manually handling indices.
